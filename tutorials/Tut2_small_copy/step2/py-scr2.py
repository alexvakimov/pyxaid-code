# Step 1 - split MD trajectory on the time steps
# Provide files listed below: "x.md.out" and "x.scf.in"
# IMPORTANT: 
# 1) use only ABSOLUTE path for PP in x.scf.in file
# 2) provided input file is just a template, so do not include coordinates
out2inp.out2inp("x.md.out","x0.scf.in","wd","x0.scf",0,tot_nsteps,1)  # neutral setup
#out2inp.out2inp("x.md.out","x1.scf.in","wd","x1.scf",0,tot_nsteps,1)  # charged setup


# Step 2 - distribute all time steps into groups(jobs) 
# several time steps per group - this is to accelerate calculations
# creates a "customized" submit file for each job and submit it - run
# a swarm in independent calculations (trajectory pieces)
# (HTC paradigm)
# Provide the files below: 
# submit_templ.pbs - template for submit files - manually edit the variables
# x.exp.in - file for export of the wavefunction
